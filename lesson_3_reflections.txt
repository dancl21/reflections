When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working for more than one computer, want to save a backup to "the cloud", want to share my work, or
am collaborating with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That way you can decide when you are ready to have changes available to collaborators and for other people to pull. That may not be on a
commit by commit basis, or even at regular time intervals. It is the same reason that you manually commit in your local repository rather
than having Git do it automatically.
